<h1 class="ad-title">Senior Ruby Developer</h1>

<p>
  100Starlings is a cooperative of professionals skilled at solving problems and creating excellent products that make
  our clients and their customers happy and more successful. Our unique mix of skills allows us to have a wide offering
  including consultancy, design, architecture, development, operations, training, and support.
</p>
<p>
  We‚Äôve been working remotely since before it became cool and value flexibility and trust. We hear each other out on the
  job, consider everyone‚Äôs input, and use it when making decisions. Outside projects we still support each other and
  appreciate and even help out with side projects (we have a variety of interests, from running projects for the benefit
  of the community, to 3d printing, electric car conversions, flying, etc).
</p>
  <p>
  Even though we work fully remotely, 100Starlings has an office in London and Budapest for occasional meetings and in
  person.
</p>
<p>
  We‚Äôre not your average employer: we believe that we are a great fit for someone who is looking for something more than
  a 9-to-5-job, a place where they have a voice, can guide and lead. We recognise and appreciate talent, and have also
  successfully supported people to grow through our team ‚Äì our senior members each have 16+ years development
  backgrounds, have contributed to Rails, Elixir, spoken at conferences, etc.
